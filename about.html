      This website was created as a way keep an easily accessible archive of
      graphics created for USC parties. These flyers often only exist on
      Instagram stories or in text conversations â€” lost forever after the event
      ends. Having this archive can serve as a source of inspiration for future
      events, or simply provide insight into visual trends popular among USC
      students at this very moment in time.<br />
